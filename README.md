# GitHub::Actions for Raku [![Test in a Raku container - template](https://github.com/JJ/raku-github-actions/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JJ/raku-github-actions/actions/workflows/test.yaml)

Use the GitHub actions console API easily from Raku. Essentially, a port to 
Raku of the [equivalent Perl module](https://metacpan.
org/pod/GitHub::Actions). It's mainly intended to be run inside the [Raku 
container for GitHub actions](https://github.com/JJ/alpine-raku), but can of 
course be used independently.
